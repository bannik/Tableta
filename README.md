react-Tableta
=====================

A pretty simple way to add tabs to your react app. This one currently works with react@0.14.0-beta3. I WILL update for latest releases. Please be so kind to notify me about the issue and discuss any idea with me, or just contribute. :)

### Trying

I use react-hot-boilerplate for this demo which you can fild here https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate.git and it goes something like this.

```
git clone https://github.com/bannik/tableta.git
cd tableta/demo
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### Using

Find the files tab.js and tableta.js in the scripts folder. Copy paste them to your project directory and include them to the file you need some tabs.

So your file should look something like this right now:

```
var tableta = require('/path/to/tableta.js');
var tab = require('/path/to/tab.js');
